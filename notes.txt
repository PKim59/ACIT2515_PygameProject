Animations don't work, currently tied to the system clock which only allows one pixel movement or instantaneous movement.
Moving to midpoint works, moving back does not.

no write to file function for custom enemy
issues loading new pattern for enemy2, enemy3 when continuing.
answer: NO NEED TO USE TOML, USE CSV or something else and write to it. Should make reading easier.

still using basic squares and not other proper sprites.

TO do: 

Fix the issues above
